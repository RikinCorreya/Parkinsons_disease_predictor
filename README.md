# Parkinson's Disease Predictor
A website on Parkinson's Disease that displays general information about the disease and can also predit if you have Parkinson's Disease or 
not based on certain test result values. 

We created a Machine Learning model and linked it to the frontend of our website using Flask so that when the user enters their test result 
values they can get an instant result if they have Parkinson's Disease or not.
